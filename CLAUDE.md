### Core Architecture Concepts

#### Async Runtime Design (Production-Ready)
- **Reactor Pattern**: Complete event loop (`seastar-core/src/reactor.rs`) with I/O polling, task scheduling, and timer management
- **Futures/Promises**: Full async primitives with continuation support, compatible with Rust's async/await
- **Advanced Scheduling**: Multi-level priority scheduling with NUMA awareness and scheduling groups
- **SMP Architecture**: Complete worker shard system with enhanced cross-shard communication
- **Memory Management**: Production-grade buffer pools with NUMA awareness and zero-copy operations

#### Shutdown Coordination System
The shutdown system (`seastar-core/src/shutdown.rs`) uses async traits with `tokio::sync::Mutex` for Send-safety:
- **ShutdownCoordinator**: Central coordinator managing graceful shutdown phases
- **ShutdownResource**: Async trait for resources that need cleanup (uses `#[async_trait::async_trait]`)
- **ShutdownPhase**: Ordered phases (StopAccepting, DrainConnections, FinalCleanup)

#### SMP (Symmetric Multiprocessing) Architecture
- **Sharded Design**: Each CPU core runs independent shard with own reactor
- **Cross-Shard Communication**: Message passing between shards for load balancing
- **Enhanced SMP**: Extended SMP system with load balancing and work distribution

#### I/O Backend Abstraction
- **Multiple Backends**: io_uring (Linux), epoll fallback, polling backend
- **Zero-Copy I/O**: Direct memory access patterns for performance
- **Async I/O Operations**: Request/response pattern with completion handling

#### Zero-Copy Networking Stack (Production-Ready)
- **Advanced TCP/UDP Stack**: Complete implementation with connection management, pooling, and health monitoring
- **Load Balancing**: Multiple strategies (Round Robin, Least Connections, IP Hash, Response Time-based)
- **Buffer Management**: Sophisticated scatter-gather I/O with zero-copy operations
- **Protocol Support**: HTTP/1.1, WebSockets, custom protocols with TLS support
- **Connection Pooling**: Production-grade pools with automatic failover and connection lifecycle management

#### Distributed Computing System (Production-Ready)
- **Raft Consensus**: Complete implementation for distributed coordination
- **Cluster Management**: Automatic node discovery, failure detection, and recovery
- **Message Passing**: Reliable message routing with delivery guarantees
- **Data Partitioning**: Hash-based and range-based partitioning strategies
- **Replication**: Configurable replication factors with consistency guarantees

#### Comprehensive Testing Framework (Production-Ready)
- **Property-Based Testing**: Advanced generators with shrinking and custom properties
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Load generation, latency analysis, and throughput testing
- **Chaos Engineering**: Fault injection, network partitioning, and failure simulation
- **Integration Testing**: Multi-service orchestration and environment management

#### Monitoring and Observability (Production-Ready)  
- **Metrics Collection**: Counter, Gauge, Histogram with thread-safe operations
- **Multiple Export Formats**: Prometheus, JSON, CSV, and custom exporters
- **System Monitoring**: CPU, memory, network, and application-specific metrics
- **Health Dashboards**: Built-in web dashboard with real-time monitoring

## Critical Implementation Details

### Async Trait Pattern
When implementing shutdown resources or similar async traits, use the async-trait pattern:
```rust
#[async_trait::async_trait]
impl ShutdownResource for MyResource {
    async fn shutdown(&mut self) -> Result<()> {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

### Mutex Usage for Send Safety
Use `tokio::sync::Mutex` instead of `std::sync::Mutex` when the data needs to be Send across await points:
```rust
use tokio::sync::Mutex;
let resources: Arc<Mutex<Vec<Box<dyn ShutdownResource>>>> = Arc::new(Mutex::new(Vec::new()));
```

### Test Dependencies
Tests require the `tempfile` crate which is added as a dev-dependency. When adding new test files, ensure proper async test setup:
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_feature() {
    // Test implementation
}
```

### Error Handling
The codebase uses `thiserror` for error handling with custom error types defined in each crate's error module.

## Development Notes

### Feature Flags
- `database`: Enables database integration features (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Redis)
- Platform-specific features automatically enabled based on target OS

### Performance Considerations
- Memory-mapped files use `memmap2` for zero-copy operations
- Aligned buffers for DMA operations in file I/O
- Lock-free data structures where possible using `crossbeam`

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests embedded in each module (`#[cfg(test)] mod tests`)
- Integration tests in `seastar-tests/` crate
- Performance benchmarks in `seastar-benchmarks/` crate
- Feature parity tests comparing with Seastar C++ behavior
