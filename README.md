    let result = make_ready_future(42).await;
    println!("Future completed with result: {}", result);
    
    // Demonstrate promise/future usage
    let (promise, future) = Promise::new();
    promise.set_value("Hello from promise!".to_string());
    
    match future.await {
        Ok(value) => println!("Promise resolved with: {}", value),

    let mut listener = TcpListener::bind(addr).await?;
    
    loop {
        match listener.accept().await {
            Ok((mut socket, peer_addr)) => {
                println!("New connection from {:?}", peer_addr);
                
                // Handle connection in background task
                tokio::spawn(async move {
                    let mut buffer = [0u8; 1024];

                            Ok(n) => {
                                // Echo the data back
                                if socket.write(&buffer[..n]).await.is_err() {

## Comparison with Original Seastar

| Feature | Original Seastar C++ | Seastar-RS |
|---------|---------------------|------------|
| Language | C++20/23 | Rust 2021 |
| Futures | Template-based | Trait-based with async/await |
| Memory Safety | Manual | Automatic via Rust |
| Concurrency | Shared-nothing | Rust async + channels |
| I/O Backend | Custom polling | io_uring + Rust async |
| Error Handling | Exceptions | Result<T, E> |
| Build System | CMake | Cargo |

The Rust implementation provides memory safety guarantees while maintaining the high-performance design principles of the original Seastar framework.
